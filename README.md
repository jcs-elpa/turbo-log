This package only has one command `turbo-log`. I would recommend you
bind this command to a keymap.

```

* `turbo-log-prefix` - default to `"â•˜[TL] "`
  - Prefix string inserted before variable name.

* `turbo-log-prefix-delimiter` - default to `: `
  - N/A

* `turbo-log-prefix-intial` - default to `t`
